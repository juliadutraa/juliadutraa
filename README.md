## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I am currently working on Community Ecology of butterflies in the Atlantic Forest, at the Butterfly Ecology Laboratory (Labbor/Unicamp).

🌱 I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Ecology and finishing my bachelor's degree in biological sciences.

🤔 I always want to learn more about the R programming language.
